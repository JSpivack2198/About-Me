    <h2>Aviation Maintenance Education</h2>


<ul>
    <li>After my military Career I trained in the basics of Aviation Maintenance here.</li>
    <li>I finished the General portion of the A&P certification program.</li>
    <li>I learned basic welding and surface grinding techniques during the airframe portion of the class.</li>
    <li>I have been to part of the Powerplant portion of classes, but I was unable to finish.</li>
    <li>Because of this education it has allowed me to gain a few jobs in the fabrication field to make and develop aircraft parts.</li>
    <li>Before I attended this class I had already claimed my GED to allow for better job opportunities</li>
</ul>
